North Sea - Energy Hub Optimisation (Hydrogen, Wind and Folating Solar)

This code was created for a research paper (DOI: ). it is an optimisaition of an offshore energy hub based on a6 decision variables subject to a limited area to maximise the NPV.

- MILP Model.
- Decision Variables:
  x1 - Wind turbines
  x2 - Floating solar installed capacity
  x3 - Battery capacity
  x4 - Electrolyser capacity
  x5 - compressor capacity
  x6 - hydrogen storage capacity
  Objective Function: Maximise NPV. 
  
The weather data and input file are not avilable for sharing but someone car replicate the work with own data for each asset.
